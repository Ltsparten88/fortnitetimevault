<!-- ABOUT THE VAULT -->
## About The Vault

This project is intended to make all resources surrounding Fortnite more accessible and known, as well as having an easy to navigate collection of all open source projects. We intend to include anything related to Fortnite and development around it, we wish to include every project that has been made for Fortnite as long as it has some relevance and/or popularity. 

We don't mind if the projects are using stolen code, we stand from an unbiased position and don't want to have any drama with anyone, that's just irrelevant for this project. Though, if a major issue with a project we've added to our vault, we may have to remove it to protect ourselves and you.

_If there are any problems with the above from either developers or epic employees, please [contact us!](#contact)_
