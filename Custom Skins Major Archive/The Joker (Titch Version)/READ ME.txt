Hi! this is Titchs custom Joker skin!

This is a work in progress hence this message, the usage of this is a little different, as for the face there are 2 swaps needed.
this is because epic decided they needed 2 John Wick faces for no reason whatsoever! so do as follows:

1. Swap the suit and hair like normal
2. Do the Face as normal
3. Do Face 2 the same way you did as Face
4. Launch!


if you need any more assistance related to this item, dm me at Tinsel Titch#2236

Thanks! - Titch

I made this back in Season 3 Before the official skin actually came out, please dont take it too seriously!
