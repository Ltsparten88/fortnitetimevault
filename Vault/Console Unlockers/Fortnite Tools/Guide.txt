NOTE: For any of this to work, you need a custom server!

Guide:
1.) Download all the files.
2.) Copy "TheEndEvent.replay" to "%localappdata%\FortniteGame\Saved\Demos".
3.) Launch Fortnite (10.40), with the custom server.
4.) Open the replay, as soon as the Battle Bus starts pause the replay.
5.) Inject "FortniteTools.dll" into FortniteClient.
6.) Go back to Fortnite, press "`" and then type "StreamMap NightNightSequenceMap". (If most of the ground is missing, this means it worked.)
7.) Seek to around "8:00", the event should start shortly.

Have fun, I have not tested the Console Unlocker on any other version other than 10.40.
